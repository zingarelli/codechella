# This README is a working in progress üöß

Right now, this README is a little Frankenstein, with loosely disconnected texts in Portuguese and English that I add while I'm developing the project. Please ignore it for now.

I'll update it with a clean and readable version when reaching certain project milestones. 

## Technologies

- node v16.15.1;
- npm v8.11.0;
- React v18.2.0;
- React Router v6.8.1;

## Instala√ß√£o

O projeto foi criado com o Create React App, utilizando Node.js e npm. √â necess√°rio estar com ambos instalados em sua m√°quina para rodar a aplica√ß√£o.

Ap√≥s clonar/baixar o projeto, abra um terminal, navegue at√© a pasta do projeto e rode o seguinte comando para instalar todas as depend√™ncias necess√°rias:

    npm install

Ap√≥s isso, voc√™ pode rodar a aplica√ß√£o em modo de desenvolvimento com o seguinte comando:

    npm start
A aplica√ß√£o ir√° rodar no endere√ßo http://localhost:3000.


## Instalation

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, using Node.js and npm. You need both installed in order to run the app.

After cloning or downloading this project, open a terminal, navigate to the project's folder and run the following command in order to install all necessary dependencies:

    npm install

*[Click here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11174) to check the info regarding an `npm audit`'s vulnerability warning that may show up in the console.*

After that, you can run the app in the development mode with the following command:

    npm start

The app will run at http://localhost:3000.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
